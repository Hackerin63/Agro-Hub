       <h2>Forage crops</h2>
       <pre>
        Forage crops, also known as fodder crops or animal feed crops, serve various purposes in agriculture and animal husbandry. 
        Here are some common uses:

                Livestock Feed 
        
                   The primary purpose of forage crops is to provide nutrition to livestock such as cattle, sheep, 
                   goats, and horses. These crops are rich in nutrients like protein, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals 
                   necessary for animal health and growth.
        
                Grazing 
            
                   Forage crops are often grown specifically for grazing by livestock. Animals are allowed to graze 
                   directly on the crops in pasture fields, providing them with fresh and natural feed.
        
                Hay Production 
            
                   Some forage crops, like alfalfa, clover, and grasses such as timothy and bermudagrass, are 
                   harvested and dried to make hay. Hay is stored and fed to livestock during periods when fresh forage 
                   is scarce, such as winter months.
        
                Silage Production 
            
                   Certain forage crops, including corn, sorghum, and legumes like alfalfa and clover, are harvested 
                   and ensiled to make silage. Silage is fermented and stored feed, often used as a supplement to fresh 
                   forage or hay, especially in dairy and beef cattle operations.
        
                Soil Improvement 
            
                    Forage crops, particularly legumes like clover and alfalfa, are beneficial for improving soil fertility 
                    through nitrogen fixation. They have symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which convert 
                    atmospheric nitrogen into forms usable by plants, enriching the soil with nitrogen.
        
                Erosion Control 
            
                    Forage crops with dense root systems, such as certain grasses and legumes, help prevent soil 
                    erosion by holding the soil in place with their roots. They are often planted in areas prone to 
                    erosion, such as sloping land or along waterways.
        
                Crop Rotation 
            
                    Forage crops are used in crop rotation systems to break pest and disease cycles, improve soil 
                    structure, and enhance overall farm productivity. They can also serve as cover crops to protect soil 
                    during fallow periods.
        
                Biodiversity 
            
                    Forage crops contribute to agricultural biodiversity by providing habitat and food sources for 
                    beneficial insects, birds, and other wildlife species.
