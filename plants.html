           <h2>Shrubs</h2>
           <pre>
              Shrubs are medium-sized, woody plants taller than herbs and shorter than a tree. Their height 
              usually ranges from 6m to 10m tall.Their features include bushy, hard, and woody stems with 
              many branches. Although stems are hard, they are flexible but not fragile.The lifespan of these 
              plants usually depends on the species. Rose, jasmine, lemon, tulsi, and henna are some of the 
              common shrubs around us.

              Shrubs are any sort of woody, perpetual, thick plants that branch into a few stems or trunks at 
              the base and is littler than a tree.Shrubs are easy to spot, they are generally short and bushy 
              and one does not see a significant part of the stem. Shrubs are otherwise called bushes. Bushes 
              are broadly utilized for decoration.

              <b>Groundcover</b>
            
                     Low-growing shrubs like creeping juniper, cotoneaster, and dwarf barberry are used to cover 
                     large areas of ground and suppress weeds.


              <b>Pollinator Gardens</b> 
                   
                     Shrubs with nectar-rich flowers, such as butterfly bush, potentilla, and buddleia, attract

              <b>Fragrant Gardens</b> 
            
                     Shrubs with fragrant flowers or foliage, such as lilac, mock orange, and gardenia, are often 
                     used in sensory gardens or near outdoor seating areas to add pleasant aromas to the air.


              <b>Specimen Plants</b> 
            
                     Unique or ornamental shrubs like Japanese maples, contorted filberts, and variegated euonymus

            <h2>Herbs</h2>
            <pre>
                Herbs are short-sized plants with soft, green, delicate stems without woody tissues. They complete their 
                life cycle within one or two seasons.Generally, they have few branches or are branchless. These can be 
                easily uprooted from the soil. Herbs contain enough nutritional benefits, including vitamins and minerals, 
                to make them a part of a healthy balanced diet. Tomato, wheat, paddy, grass and bananas are a few examples 
                of herbs.

            <h2>Climbers</h2>
            <pre>
                Climbers are much more advanced than creepers. Climbers have a very thin, long and weak stem 
                which cannot stand upright, but they can use external support to grow vertically and carry 
                their weight. These types of plants use special structures called tendrils to climb. A few 
                climbersâ€™ plant names include pea plant, grapevine, sweet gourd, money plant, jasmine, runner 
                beans, green peas, etc.

            <pre class="b">

                  <b>Vining Climbers</b> 
                
                         These plants have long, flexible stems that twine around structures or other plants for 
                         support. They are often used to cover fences, trellises, and pergolas, adding vertical 
                         interest to gardens and providing privacy.

                  <b>Scramblers</b> 
                
                         These climbers have stiff, arching stems that can be trained to climb or allowed to sprawl 
                         across the ground.They are useful for covering unsightly structures or filling in gaps in 
                         garden borders.

                  <b>Twiners</b> 
                
                         These climbers have stems that wrap around supports in a helical fashion. They are excellent 
                         for covering arbors,arches, and other vertical structures, providing shade and enhancing visual 
                         appeal.

                  <b>Clinging Climbers</b> 
                
                         These plants have specialized structures such as aerial roots or adhesive pads that allow them to 
                         attach themselves to walls and other surfaces. They are ideal for covering masonry walls, fences, 
                         and buildings, adding greenery to urban environments.

                  <b>Climbing Roses</b> 
                
                         These are a specific type of climbing plant prized for their beautiful blooms and fragrance. They are 
                         often trained along fences, walls, and trellises to create stunning floral displays.

                  <b>Edible Climbers</b> 
                
                         Some climbing plants, such as grapevines and kiwi vines, produce edible fruits. They can be grown on 
                         trellises or pergolas in home gardens, providing both ornamental value and a harvest of fresh produce.

                  <b>Evergreen Climbers</b>
                
                         These climbers retain their foliage year-round, providing greenery and structure to the garden even in 
                         winter.They are useful for covering structures that need to be screened year-round or for adding green 
                         accents to vertical spaces.

              Creepers, as the name suggests, are plants that creep on the ground. They have very fragile, long, thin 
              stems that can neither stand erect nor support all their weight. Examples include watermelon, strawberry, 
              pumpkin and sweet potatoes.

                  <b>Ground Covers</b>
            
                     These low-growing creepers spread horizontally and are used to cover bare ground, suppress weeds, and 
                     prevent soil erosion. Examples include creeping thyme, vinca minor, and creeping juniper.

                  <b>Climbing Creepers</b> 
            
                     These plants have trailing or vining stems that can be trained to climb up structures or other plants for 
                     support.They are often used to cover walls, trellises, fences, and pergolas, adding greenery and softening 
                     hardscape elements.Examples include ivy, creeping fig, and sweet potato vine.

                  <b>Hanging Basket Plants</b> 
            
                     These creepers have trailing stems that cascade gracefully over the edges of containers, making them perfect 
                     for hanging baskets, window boxes, and elevated planters. They add a cascading effect and are ideal for 
                     adding vertical interest to patios, balconies, and porches. Examples include trailing petunias, bacopa, and 
                     trailing lobelia.

                  <b>Edible Creepers</b> 
            
                     Some creeper plants produce edible fruits or foliage, making them valuable for both ornamental and culinary 
                     purposes.Examples include strawberries, creeping rosemary, and nasturtiums.

                  <b>Indoor Creepers</b> 
            
                     These creepers are well-suited for indoor environments and can be grown in hanging baskets or allowed to 
                     trail over shelves and furniture. They help purify indoor air and add a touch of greenery to interior 
                     spaces.Examples include pothos, string of pearls, and spider plant.

                  <b>Aromatic Creepers</b>
            
                     Certain creepers are valued for their aromatic foliage or flowers, which can add fragrance to the garden or 
                     indoor spaces. Examples include creeping thyme, scented geraniums, and sweet alyssum.

                  <b>Wildlife Attracting Creepers</b>

            Trees are big and tall plants. They have very thick, woody and hard stems called the trunk. This single 
            main stem or the trunk gives rise to many branches that bear leaves, flowers and fruits. Some trees are 
            branchless like coconut trees; i.e., they have only one main stem which bears leaves, flowers, and fruits 
            all by itself. The lifespan of a tree is very long. i.e., for several years. Banyan, mango, neem, cashew, 
            teak and oak are some examples of trees.
